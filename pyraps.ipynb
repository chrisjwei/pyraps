    "For our final project, we will be attempting to classify rap styles based on song lyrics. We will be using a subsection of rap music published in the 1990's, where rap style from different geographical regions were distinct, which differs from modern rap music has become more of an almalgamation of the three main rap styles. The two main geographical regions we will be looking at are east-coast (New York City), west-coast (Los Angeles) - we may extend this to further classify more modern movements such as southern (Atlanta) and midwest (Detroit).\n",

We can fill in the gaps by approximating the pronunciations using [CMU Lextools](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lextool.html). The following code finds all the unknown words and writes them to a file as input to the lextool. We then need to parse the return dict file from the lextool and refill unknown pronunciations with our approximations."
